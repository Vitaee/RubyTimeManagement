## Ruby Time Management Project 
This is my first ruby on rails project. I learned a lot about the framework, while developing this. Steps are necessary to get the application up and running.

### Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version
    - ruby 3.0.4p208 (2022-04-12 revision 3fa771dded) [x86_64-linux]
    - Rails 7.0.4

* Configuration
    - ```bundle install```
    - create .env in project root and put your ```DB_HOST``` to .env file
    ```.env
    DB_HOST=172.17.0.2
    ```
    - rails db:migrate
